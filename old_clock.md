The Clock Is a Bifurcation Machine

Correction note

The clock model no longer treats “synchronized” as a single binary condition. Synchronization can appear and disappear through different bifurcations depending on the state space, oscillator count, frequency distribution, forcing, inertia, delay, phase lag and observable.

The same sine coupling can therefore produce several mathematically distinct clocks.

[
\boxed{
\text{Same law. Different quotient. Different bifurcation. Different clock.}
}
]

1. Mean field, pair and triad are different machines

The infinite-population Kuramoto transition is an instability of the incoherent mean field:

[
R=0\longrightarrow R>0.
]

For a symmetric unimodal frequency distribution, this is ordinarily a pitchfork-type onset of collective amplitude.

Two oscillators reduce to the Adler equation,

[
\dot\phi=\Delta\omega-K\sin\phi.
]

Their locking transition is a saddle-node on the circle: a stable locked point and an unstable threshold are created together. Below threshold, the relative phase runs and repeatedly slips.

A triad has two independent relative phases,

[
\boldsymbol\varphi

(\theta_2-\theta_1,\theta_3-\theta_1)
\in T^2.
]

Its generic locking transition is a saddle-node of relative equilibria on the two-torus. A sink and saddle appear together. The sink supplies stable relative locking; the saddle and its stable manifold remain as the slip boundary.

Therefore,

[
\boxed{
R=0\text{ pitchfork}
\neq
\text{Adler SNIPER}
\neq
\text{triad saddle-node}
\neq
\text{bimodal Hopf or homoclinic transition}.
}
]

These are not different names for the same event. They occur in different reduced state spaces and create coherence by different mechanisms.

2. The clock has a hand and a gear state

The triad must be decomposed into collective phase and relative phase:

[
\dot\Theta

\Omega(\boldsymbol\varphi;\mu),
\qquad
\dot{\boldsymbol\varphi}

F(\boldsymbol\varphi;\mu),
]

where \mu denotes the frozen control parameters.

The relative state \boldsymbol\varphi determines whether the oscillators remain locked. The collective phase \Theta advances the hand.

This repairs an earlier mistake: a locked relative equilibrium cannot repeatedly cross a section in relative-phase space. At lock,

[
\dot{\boldsymbol\varphi}=0.
]

The relative gears have stopped moving against one another, while the collective hand may continue rotating.

Accordingly:

- A tick is an oriented crossing of a section in collective physical phase.
- A slip is a crossing of the saddle separatrix in relative-phase space.
- A lock is confinement of \boldsymbol\varphi to the basin of the stable relative equilibrium.
- Clock failure is loss of that equilibrium, uncontrolled winding slips, or loss of coherent collective phase advance.

For the frozen field construction, the physical hand is

[
\Theta_\Phi

\arg\sum_i z_i^2.
]

Because \Phi=z^2, the six minima of the fine-field anisotropy fold under

[
\theta\sim\theta+\pi
]

to three physical positions. The gauge-invariant ticks are therefore

[
\widetilde\Theta_\Phi(t_n)

\frac{2\pi n}{3},
\qquad
\dot{\widetilde\Theta}_\Phi(t_n)>0.
]

Six physical ticks would require an additional gauge-invariant witness. Until such a witness exists, the defensible dial has three positions.

3. Ticks and slips are different witnesses

Lift the relative phase trajectory from T^2 to its covering space. Its winding record is

[
\mathbf m\in\mathbb Z^2.
]

A relative-phase slip produces

[
\Delta\mathbf m\neq0.
]

A parity register may be defined by

[
\mathbf q_{\mathrm{tri}}=\mathbf m\bmod2\in\mathbb Z_2^2,
]

but \(\mathbf q_{\mathrm{tri}}\) is derived. It erases both direction and even winding increments. It cannot distinguish clockwise from counterclockwise slips.

This triad register must not be silently identified with the field protocol’s

[
W\in\mathbb Z^3,\qquad q_{\mathrm{gauge}}=W\bmod2\in\mathbb Z_2^3.
]

The triad lives on T^2; the finite-volume gauge construction has three noncontractible spatial axes in T^3. Relating them requires an explicit constructor.

Likewise, the global Kuramoto transformation

[
\theta_i\mapsto\theta_i+\chi
]

is a global S^1 symmetry. It is not the frozen field theory’s local Z_2 gauge redundancy. Both permit a quotient, but they are different equivalence relations.

4. The proper clock state

For the first-order triad comparator M_0,

[
\mathcal C_0

(R_\Phi,\widetilde\Theta_\Phi,\Omega_\Phi[F],\boldsymbol\varphi,\mathbf m,\mathbf q_{\mathrm{tri}}=\mathbf m\bmod2;\mu).
]

The velocity \dot{\boldsymbol\varphi} is determined by the vector field and is not an independent state coordinate.

For an inertial driven model D_1,

[
\mathcal C_1

(
R_\Phi,\widetilde\Theta_\Phi,\Omega_\Phi,
\boldsymbol\varphi,\dot{\boldsymbol\varphi},
\mathbf m,\mathbf q_{\mathrm{tri}}=\mathbf m\bmod2;\mu
).
]

The operational question is no longer merely whether the oscillators are synchronized. It is:

«Which section was crossed, in which direction, from which basin, with what winding change, and what state followed?»

5. What the saddle-node does

Before the triad’s locking threshold, the relative state runs or wanders across T^2. Phase crossings may still occur, but their intervals are degraded by relative drift and slips.

At the saddle-node threshold, a sink and saddle appear together.

Above threshold:

- the sink stabilizes the relative phase offsets;
- the collective phase can advance coherently;
- the saddle’s stable manifold remains the boundary of the locked basin;
- a sufficiently large perturbation can cross that boundary and produce a slip.

The saddle therefore continues to matter after synchronization. It is the clock’s escape threshold.

The frozen bifurcation test should:

1. continue equilibria of F(\boldsymbol\varphi;K);
2. show the sink and saddle appearing at the same K_c;
3. verify that one real Jacobian eigenvalue crosses zero;
4. exclude an earlier Hopf instability;
5. reconstruct the saddle separatrix;
6. record every crossing as a signed winding event;
7. test pre-onset slip-time scaling without assuming the Adler exponent in advance.

Triad saddle-node onset is generic, not universal. Symmetry, delay, phase lag, forcing or inertia can instead produce pitchforks, Hopf bifurcations, heteroclinic cycles or other global transitions.

6. M_0, M_1, D_0 and D_1

The lanes are now separate.

M_0: fixed-coupling triad comparator

[
K=\text{constant}.
]

This identifies the basic running-to-locking transition and its saddle separatrix.

M_1: geometry-dependent coupling

[
K=K(\psi).
]

If K(\psi) is merely a smooth frozen modulation, it moves the existing bifurcation through parameter space. It does not automatically create a new universality class.

If \psi is itself dynamical, feeds back into the coupling, or periodically forces the system, the enlarged system may acquire bifurcation delay, hysteresis, parametric locking, Hopf onset or torus dynamics. Those effects require their own declaration.

D_0: overdamped relaxation

D0 measures relaxation, diffusion and phase-slip kinetics. It does not establish a self-sustaining clock. Without a drive, it relaxes toward equilibrium.

D_1: the escapement

D1 requires a declared physical-time law containing:

- inertia or another phase-storage mechanism;
- damping;
- drive;
- the threefold/sixfold teeth;
- noise rules;
- a gauge-link evolution law;
- a gauge-invariant hand;
- and preregistered tick, slip and failure predicates.

Its necessary tests include:

[
\omega

\lim_{T\to\infty}
\frac{\widetilde\Theta_\Phi(T)-\widetilde\Theta_\Phi(0)}{T}
\neq0,
]

finite phase diffusion D_\Theta, stable tick intervals, recovery after perturbation, declared locking regions and explicit winding-slip accounting.

A useful coherence measure is

[
Q_{\mathrm{clk}}

\frac{|\omega|}{2D_\Theta}.
]

Drive removal must make the asymptotic drift die after inertial relaxation. Drive reversal must reverse the tick direction outside any preregistered pinning interval. A local Z_2 gauge transformation must leave the tick record unchanged.

7. Relation to the frozen field theory

Frozen Theory v0.1 supplies equilibrium gears:

- the fine field z;
- the physical field \Phi=z^2;
- local Z_2 redundancy;
- global Z_3 order;
- and the first allowed phase-selecting operator z^6+z^{*6}.

Appendix A supplies the exact finite-volume T^3 sector architecture and its \mathbb Z_2^3 winding-parity register.

TTSC supplies a prescribed periodic spatial throat profile.

None of those objects supplies physical-time evolution. Monte Carlo steps sample an equilibrium distribution; they are not clock time.

D1 is therefore a new dynamics protocol. It does not amend frozen Theory v0.1 and cannot borrow physical-time meaning from equilibrium currents.

Frozen conclusion

The discovery is not that every Kuramoto system has one synchronization switch.

The discovery is that a clock is assembled from separate witnesses:

[
\boxed{
\text{collective phase}
+
\text{relative locking}
+
\text{saddle separatrix}
+
\text{winding slips}
+
\text{successor law}.
}
]

The saddle-node creates the relative lock. The collective phase advances the hand. The separatrix defines the escape threshold. Winding records the slips. D1 supplies the physical-time successor law.

[
\boxed{
\text{Same sine coupling. Different quotient. Different bifurcation. Different clock.}
}
]
